## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;  # (This won't work in WebContainers, as git is not available)
    ```
    Since you are in WebContainer and git is not available, you should already have the project files.

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173` or similar).
